    <div class="text">
        Fleeting is an ongoing experimental typeface project which uses variable-font technology to communicate a story about the dynamic between design and technology evolvement. 

Through animation, the typeface demonstrates three stages: Phase 1 has an x-acto knife symbol representing the pre-printing period, Phase 2 is made from a hand-cut paper describing a fleeting scene, and the final typeface with various geometric shapes and sci-fi elements representing the post-printing period and the future.
